I'm the designer, front-end developer and owner of Marty Louis Co., a one-man design studio that helps professionals, startups, and established companies, build, update and maintain their website and brand.

For over 10 years, I've been involved in various aspects of design and development for both web and print. I started out just making but then moved over to working on web design and learning to code.

Now I design & build websites from the ground up. I occasionally provide brand services, like logo and business collateral design.

I work remotely with marketing companies to support their front-end projects and client websites.
