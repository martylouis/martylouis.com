          ðŸ™Œ Hey, Iâ€™m Marty. I live in Destin, FL, where I design and build
          stuff.

        <div class="mt-6 space-y-7 text-base text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my
            first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom
            brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to
            type on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When
            I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard
            while wearing my older sisterâ€™s motorcycle helmet, counted down from
            three, and jumped â€” hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a
            bit of momentum Iâ€™d be able to get to orbit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
            while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
            badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent
            my dadâ€™s Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back
            down to our family computer from space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Iâ€™m the founder of Planetaria, where weâ€™re working on
            civilian space suits and manned shuttle kits you can assemble at
            home so that the next generation of kids really <em>can</em> make it
            to orbit â€” from the comfort of their own backyards.
